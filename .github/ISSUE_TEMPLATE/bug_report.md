Thanks for reporting an issue! If it relates to a failure handling a particular repository, please include:

- The output of `arxiv-collector --version`.
- The output of `arxiv-collector --debug yourproject.tex`, inside `<details>` so it's not a million lines to scroll through.
- If at all reasonable, attach or link to the failing project. Feel free to remove as much as possible where it still fails.
